# The Predicament at Pandas Pizzeria

Let's assume that you've been hired on as an assistant for Pandas Pizzeria, the premiere pizza place in the village of Analyston. You enter the establishment and are immediately greeted by dishes breaking, screaming, and overall chaos. It seems that the manager and the chef are arguing over what to put on the menu, as it's a new fiscal year starting today. The manager notices you and sighs a breath of relief. "Thank goodness you're here," they say, "You can solve this for us. You said in the interview you have experience with Pandas, yes?"

You nod, excited to finally be putting your newfound data skills to some real use.

"Excellent. I have a few files here from the last year's sales. I also have a list of questions I'd like you to answer to help us make a new menu. In general, we'll need you to join these files into one dataframe and analyze the popularity of the pizzas over different frames of time, as well as a few other helpful tidbits of information. 

Once you've done all that, if it all checks out, then I'll ask you what you think we should do specifically to improve the menu, so keep that in mind while you're doing your analysis. Sound good? Great! Good luck."

The CSV files are sent to you and you get down to business.
